Are you the type of person that needs to track every little expense during the month or usually forget what was that expense on your bank account? You don't like to open your bank account in the street because the people around you could watch your information or it's too tedious to login every time?

My Finances is an Android application for that. It helps you to track all of your incomes and expenses with detail, visualizing them into different categories or between dates. Easy to use, easy to open and easy to know in a few seconds your balance.
